Documents are ingested, chunked semantically (500–1000 tokens with overlap), and embedded using a model like text-embedding-3-small. Embeddings are stored in a vector database (pgvector or Pinecone). At query time, hybrid search combines dense vector retrieval with BM25 keyword search, then a reranker (e.g. Cohere Rerank) improves precision. The top-k chunks are injected into an LLM prompt with a strict grounding instruction: only answer from retrieved context, cite sources, say "I don't know" if nothing is found. Access control is enforced at retrieval time, filter by document permissions before returning chunks. The evaluation framework tracks retrieval recall@k, answer faithfulness (does the answer match retrieved context?), and latency p95.

The draft note is surfaced to the physician immediately post-visit for review and one-click editing before it's signed. Structured data (diagnosis codes, medications, vitals) are extracted and pushed to the EHR via FHIR APIs to auto-populate structured fields rather than relying on free-text alone.

Transactions above a threshold are blocked or flagged; borderline cases go to Layer 2. Layer 2 uses an LLM to synthesize signals and generate a human-readable explanation for analyst review, the LLM is not in the primary detection path because it can't hit 100ms. Analysts review flagged transactions and their decisions feed back into weekly model retraining.

For the shopping assistant specifically, a semantic search layer maps natural language queries to item embeddings, enabling "show me something for a beach vacation under $50" queries. Business constraints (sponsored products, inventory limits, margin floors) are applied as a post-ranking filter.

Start read-only, pull data from each EHR via FHIR APIs into a unified patient record store, mapping to a canonical FHIR R4 data model. The hardest problem is patient matching: the same patient exists in all 6 systems with slightly different demographics. Build a probabilistic Master Patient Index using name, DOB, address, and MRN to create a unified patient ID. Pilot with one site and one clinical use case (e.g., care transitions).

Build a normalization layer that maps each system's schema to a canonical loan record model, with explicit reconciliation rules for conflicts. Pre-compute the key risk metrics (portfolio concentration, delinquency rates, covenant headroom) nightly and serve them from a simple database. The board presentation needs 3-5 numbers, not 50. Spend week 1 nailing down exactly which metrics matter to the board, that defines everything.

Store POS systems are the hardest: many don't support webhooks, so you poll on a 5-minute cycle for V1. A reservation system is critical for the peak season, when a customer adds to cart, inventory is soft-reserved to prevent overselling under concurrent load. Given 10 weeks to peak, ruthlessly cut scope: launch with online + top 50 stores (highest volume) first, then roll out to remaining 350. Monitor accuracy by sampling: weekly comparison of system counts against physical counts at 10 stores. 73% accuracy today means there's bad data in the source systems, surface and fix the top 5 data quality issues first.`,

Separate root causes: is churn from product gaps, poor onboarding, lack of ongoing support, or a bad-fit customer that sales shouldn't have sold?

Separate "won't use" (skeptics who don't see value) from "can't use" (workflow or technical barrier).

Bank transaction data (cash flow consistency, revenue trends) is more predictive than credit scores for SMBs. The distribution strategy is equally critical: direct sales is expensive, broker networks have margin pressure, but embedding in accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero) where SMBs already manage cash flow is the highest-leverage channel.

The top issues in marketplace seller dissatisfaction are almost always: fee changes, search/ranking algorithm changes that reduced visibility, policy enforcement inconsistency, and slow dispute resolution.

Months 1-3: workflow redesign with clinical champions in every department before build begins. Physician champions (2-3 per department) participate in build decisions and advocate to peers, without physician buy-in, Epic go-lives fail because physicians route around the system. Months 4-8: system build and configuration.

Months 13-18: go-live in waves, one facility at a time, with a 2-week embedded command center per facility (Epic analysts and super-users in every unit 24/7). Hold 15% budget in contingency.

Month 3-6: stand up a care management team focused on this high-risk cohort, nurse care managers and social workers doing proactive outreach to prevent avoidable hospitalizations. Physician engagement: share attribution lists and performance data with every PCP, they need to know which patients are attributed and how they're performing on quality metrics.

Carrier model: building an owned fleet takes 12+ months. Gig delivery networks (DoorDash Drive, Uber Direct) can launch in 6-8 weeks but have higher per-delivery cost and less control, for a 6-month timeline, gig delivery is the only realistic option for initial launch. Tech is the critical path: order management changes (cutoff time logic, 2-hour delivery window selection, real-time inventory reservation at city-level fulfillment node) typically take 3-4 months.

Three layers. Layer 1: prevention, risk-score every new seller at onboarding by business type, category intent, and document quality. Apply proportional friction. Cheaper than enforcement after harm is done. Layer 2: detection, ML-based listing risk scoring running on every new listing before it goes live in high-risk categories (electronics, luxury goods, pharmaceuticals). Rights holders get a brand portal for DMCA-style takedown requests, they're your best counterfeit detection partners. Layer 3: enforcement, graduated response (warning → listing removal → suspension → permanent ban + legal).
