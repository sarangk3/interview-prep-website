Key components a strong answer should cover:

Full conversation:
${transcript}

Score the candidate (1-10, honest and calibrated) and assess which key components they identified:
- structure: How organized and structured was their thinking?
- depth: How deep and specific were their answers?
- problem_solving: How well did they approach and break down the problem?
- adaptability: How well did they respond to follow-ups and pivot when challenged?
- communication: How clearly did they express their ideas?

Also identify which key components the candidate covered vs missed.

The ideal solution has these key components — you know them, the candidate does not:
${(keyComponents||[]).map((c,i)=>`${i+1}. ${c}`).join('\n')}

Your job: ask questions that progressively reveal whether the candidate knows these components. If they miss a component, ask a question that points them toward it WITHOUT revealing the answer directly.

Difficulty: ${difficulty}. ${cfg.tone}

Turn ${turn} of ${maxTurns}.
${isFinalTurn

  : `${currentHint ? `If the candidate has NOT addressed this area yet, steer toward it: "${currentHint}"` : 'Probe the most important gap in their answer so far.'}

React SPECIFICALLY to what the candidate just said. ${turn===1?'Acknowledge their opening approach in one sentence, then push on the most critical gap.':'Go deeper on a specific detail they haven\'t fully addressed.'}
2-4 sentences maximum. End with ONE sharp, specific question — not "tell me more", but a pointed question about a specific design decision or tradeoff.`}

Stay in character. Never reveal the ideal solution. Never say "good job" without following it with a harder question.`;
